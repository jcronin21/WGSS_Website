# WGSS_Website

Overview
This repository is dedicated to the development of a website for my Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) African American Women History class. The primary goal of this website is to explore the intersection of technology, artificial intelligence, and the unique challenges faced by Black Women in this context. Our central theme will be "Racism in AI: Impact on Black Women."
