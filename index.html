            Racism and bias in AI refer to the systemic issues within artificial intelligence systems that perpetuate or amplify prejudices present in society.
            These biases can arise from various sources, including biased datasets, flawed algorithms, or the lack of diversity in the development and training
            of AI systems. AI algorithms learn patterns from the data they are trained on, and if that data contains biases or reflects societal inequalities,
            the AI can perpetuate these biases in its decision-making processes. For instance, facial recognition systems have shown biases against certain
            ethnicities, leading to misidentification and discrimination. Furthermore, the lack of diversity among AI researchers and developers can result
            in oversight of biases during the creation and implementation of AI systems. It's crucial to address these biases to ensure fairness, equity, and
            accuracy in AI technologies, emphasizing ethical considerations and diverse representation in the development process.
