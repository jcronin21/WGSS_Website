      <p>
        In the realm of computing, there exist explicit and implicit challenges 
        concerning race and ethnicity. Scholars like Ihudiya Finda Ogbonnaya-Ogburu 
        have shed light on these issues, specifically within organizations like SIGCHI.
        Ogbonnaya-Ogburu's insights emphasize the importance of addressing these challenges,
        as they affect not only the field of computing but also broader societal systems.

        One notable segment by Ihudiya Finda Ogbonnaya-Ogburu raises crucial points about 
        the representation and inclusion of racial and ethnic minorities within computing 
        communities. The lack of diversity in images, research groups, and events serves as 
        a demonstration of the broken systems within these spaces.

        Quote:
        "As an organization, we have yet to collectively deep dive into establishing policies and actionable approaches to address issues related to race and ethnicity. My presence as the sole African American woman in many spaces should serve as a reminder that our systems are broken."

      Connecting to Literature and Womanhood
      This discussion resonates deeply with our exploration of womanhood in
      African American literature. The same struggles for representation and 
      acknowledgment of diversity within computing intersect with the portrayal
      and recognition of African American womanhood in literature and academic studies.
